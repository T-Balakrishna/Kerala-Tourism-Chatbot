# Kerala Tourism Chatbot

## Problem Statement

### Problem Being Addressed
Planning a trip to Kerala is often overwhelming due to the wide variety of tourist destinations —  
serene backwaters, misty hill stations, pristine beaches, wildlife sanctuaries, spice plantations,  
cultural heritage sites, and Ayurvedic wellness centres.

Travelers frequently face confusion regarding:

- Which destinations are most suitable for different **group types**  
  (adventure-focused boys’ trips, relaxed family vacations, budget-friendly college trips,  
  girls’ getaways, romantic couple trips)
- **Budget** considerations (low-cost backpacker options vs mid-range vs luxury experiences)
- **Best time to visit** (peak winter season, monsoon advantages/disadvantages, summer hill escapes)
- **Ideal trip duration** (short 2–4 day getaways vs comprehensive 7–10 day tours)

Without personalized, reliable guidance, people end up with mismatched itineraries, missed hidden gems,  
weather-related disappointments, or unnecessarily high expenses.

This LLM-powered chatbot solves these real-world planning challenges by delivering **tailored recommendations**,  
**customized itineraries**, and accurate answers based on user inputs about group type, budget, season,  
number of days, and preferences.
